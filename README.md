# Machine_learning_from_scratch
In this little notebook I wanted to present a little  process to build a project for machine learning using two algorithms, Namely naive bayes and decision tree as an example. All the time the work is structured.  We start with the pre-processing using statistics to describe and understand the data. and then use several techniques depending on the data and the problem we want to solve for the pre-processing before building the machine learning model. finally we can build the model using the pre-processed data and evaluate the performance before validating the model.
